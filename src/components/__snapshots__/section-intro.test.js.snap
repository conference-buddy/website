            Conference Buddy is for everyone who wants to attend a tech conference but is 
            <strong>
              afraid to go alone
            </strong>
            . It's for everyone at tech events who is 
            <strong>
              not comfortable being on their own
            </strong>
             all the time. Itâ€™s for 
            <strong>
              all you
            </strong>
             first-timers, Introverts, socially awkwards, timid and shy people out there who are just like me!
